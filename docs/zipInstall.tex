You must have a program for
extracting files from the ``zipped'' file 

{\bf \sps.zip}.


To install the code:
\begin{enumerate}
\item extract the files in some folder/directory
where you can  create the directory {\bf sp\_solve}
\item cd sp\_solve
\item type matlab -nodesktop at shell prompt
\item type SPInstall at matlab prompt\footnote{Version 6 users will
need to either 1) notify matlab of the existence of new java programs, or
2)guarantee that ``!java -version'' executes an external version of java.
To aide in implementing the first approach,
the SPInstall program generates operating system specific
SPClasspathOsName.txt files that one can use to update the
original classpath.txt files.  See Matlab External Interfaces/API
Chapter 5(Page 5-7) for details.}
\item type SPRunTests  at matlab prompt\footnote{On SunOs boxes, one can
also run SPRunSunOsTests}
\end{enumerate}
